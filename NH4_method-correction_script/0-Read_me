Three codes are used for samples size correction and calibration.
The first code, _NH4_1_iso_size_corr+calib_CALC.py, determines the best tuple for size correction and calibration.
It is needs 2 files:
- input_measured_blanks.txt
- input_measured_iso_stds.txt

The second code, _NH4_2_iso_size_corr+calib_PLOT_V3.py, calculates the size corrected and calibrated values of the measured samples.
It needs the output files from code 1 and the input_measured_samples.txt

The third code gather the functions and the standard values necessary in the two codes.
